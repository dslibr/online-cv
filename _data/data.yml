    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Welcome! My name is Lisa Over. I manage research data for a multifaceted study focused on the care and outcomes of traumatic injuries with the goal of 
      updating existing standards of care. I develop reports and applications to support study administration and perform data munging tasks to make complex 
      datasets ready for analysis. I focus on the needs of my clients, which include other data managers, data analysts, project managers, and study directors. 
      I am part of a team that makes sense of data for the benefit of the public. What I do is essential to people, and the families of people, who receive 
      better care as a result of this study.

      My professional goal brings together my expertise and enthusiasm for computer programming, statistics, and math; my desire to solve problems that benefit 
      people, organizations, or society; and my conviction to embrace challenges and life-long learning. I also enjoy teaching, and I volunteer with the 
      Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation (CAASI) at the University of Pittsburgh to mentor undergraduate social science students who 
      are using open civic data to solve problems.

      I bring a set of core teaching, communication, and programming skills as well as professionalism, dedication, and perseverance to everything I do. 
      I am an enthusiastic, independent worker who values constructive criticism and welcomes opportunities to collaborate with peers. I gravitate toward 
      intellectual challenges and am inclined to try new approaches or techniques in my work.

      Thank you for your interest in my resume and portfolio.
